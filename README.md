# Libri-Light 60k Synthesis Project

## Overview

This project aims to synthesize the Libri-Light 60k hour dataset by creating textual transcriptions for each audio file in the dataset. The "Books" folder in this repository will contain the transcriptions of every book included in the audio dataset. Our goal is to explore whether synthesizing this dataset enhances the semantic performance of our speech-language model.
## Motivation

The Libri-Light dataset, originally developed by Meta, is a large-scale collection of unlabeled speech derived from audiobooks. By creating a synthesized version with accurate transcriptions, we can provide a more substantial training ground for developing an advanced speech-language model with increased semantic performance.

## Update

I am currently getting the transcription of the audio file from https://www.gutenberg.org/

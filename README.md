# Libri-Light 60k Synthesis Project

## Overview

This project aims to synthesize the Libri-Light 60k hour dataset by creating textual transcriptions for each audio file in the dataset. The "Books" folder in this repository will contain the transcriptions of every book included in the audio dataset. Our goal is to explore whether synthesizing this dataset enhances the semantic performance of speech recognition models.

## Motivation

The Libri-Light dataset, originally developed by Meta, is a large-scale collection of unlabeled speech derived from audiobooks. By creating a synthesized version with accurate transcriptions, we can provide a more substantial training ground for developing advanced speech recognition technologies.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community. Here are some ways you can contribute:
- **Transcribing audio files**: You can help by listening to the audio files and transcribing them into text.
- **Reviewing transcriptions**: Ensuring the accuracy of the transcriptions by reviewing and correcting them.
- **Technical improvements**: Propose or implement improvements to the synthesis and training processes.
